                                    Every tooth consists of three different layers. The outermost and hardest layer is enamel, and the second layer is dentin. The third is pulp, which is the cavernous space where the live tissue and nerve of each tooth is located.

                                    If for any reason the pulp space is exposed to the outside, the tissue becomes contaminated and eventually infected. The exposure of pulp happens in many circumstances, such as when you have a large cavity or a fractured tooth. Your dentist can explain the exact reason for damage to this tissue. In these cases, the treatment is usually root canal treatment.
                                    Root canal treatment is the process of going inside the pulp space and removing the infected, dead tissue. The space is then disinfected and sealed with special materials. Nowadays, root canal treatments are performed with advanced techniques and materials, making them far more comfortable and faster. After root canal treatment is complete, your restorative dentist will usually place a crown on your tooth to safeguard against fracture.

                                    If you have any questions about root canal treatments and you live in Hyderabad or surrounding area, give us a call today! 8106666684 / 8919074607

                                    Orthodontic treatment is for everyone.  Straight teeth can not only better your smile, but make it easier for you to talk and chew your food.

                                    <br />
                                    We are often asked about the ideal age for braces, but the reality is that braces aren't just for children and teenagers. More and more of our adult patients at Elite Family Dental , Attapur ,Hyderabad are choosing braces to give themselves a more attractive, comfortable smile.

                                <dd>
                                    <p>A crown (cap) is a restoration that is placed on teeth that have lost a lot of their structure. There are various types of crowns, ranging from full porcelain to full metal crowns. Your dentist will explain the advantages and disadvantages of each kind for you.</p>
                                    <p>Crowns may also be used to securely attach a bridge if the structure of the surrounding teeth is inadequate. A bridge is a dental appliance that is used to replace one or more missing teeth. They are designed to be cosmetically appealing and to restore proper occlusion. Like crowns, bridges are fully customizable and made of various materials, including porcelain and metals. Although not as permanent as a cap, bridges are bonded to the surrounding teeth and only removable by your dentist.</p>
                                    <p>Both crowns and bridges are created to match the color, height, texture, and overall appearance of your teeth. Most crowns and bridges will last for life, eliminating the need to replace them unless they fall out or become loose. You may prolong the durability of your crowns and bridges by practicing good oral hygiene and visiting your dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings.</p>

                                    <p>Don’t let missing teeth – or a single tooth - negatively impact your life. Your self-esteem and your general health can be instantly boosted with a simple procedure – so you can smile in photographs, feel comfortable in social situations, and eat your favorite foods with ease.</p>
                                    <p>Elite Family Dental , Attapur ,Hyderabad is your source for dental implants in Hyderbad. Let us show you the solution that can increase your confidence and benefit your overall health.</p>
                                    <p>When you’re missing a tooth, the surrounding teeth will shift position in an attempt to fill the gap, and your jawbone can break down. This may change your appearance and cause you to look older. A denture doesn’t prevent the jawbone from breaking down, because it just sits on the surface.</p>
                                    <p>If you are missing a tooth — or missing multiple teeth — the team at Elite Family Dental , Attapur ,Hyderabad can use dental implants to help restore your smile.</p>
                                    <p>Dental implants are small titanium screws that replace the missing root and function like a tooth root. The implant is integrated into your jawbone for a long-lasting, secure restoration. A crown is then attached to the implant, giving you the look of a natural tooth. Dental implants can also be used to secure a denture, preventing it from shifting in your mouth. Elite Family Dental , Attapur ,Hyderabad</p>

                                    <p>This is one way to quickly get that beautiful smile. Veneers are a thin shell of porcelain or resin that is bonded to the surface of the teeth. This can change their shape, shade, and position to improve the cosmetics of your teeth and smile. They are also used to replace and restore any lost tooth structure where indicated.</p>
                                    <p>Your dentist will do a complete examination of your teeth to determine if veneers are ideal for you. Veneers often provide the opportunity to dramatically transform the aesthetics of your teeth and smile.</p>
                                    <p>Veneers can enhance the shape of your teeth, make your teeth as white as you want, and give you the smile you have always desired. Additionally, Veneers are bonded to your tooth structure, which gives them strength.</p>
                                    <p>Since they are very thin, Veneers are considered one of the most conservative cosmetic treatments available. Most of the time, very little or no tooth structure is removed before placing veneers. Ask your dentist how veneers can improve your smile.</p>

                                    <p>Though many advances have been made in the field of dentistry, loss of teeth is still an ongoing problem. In the India, 26% of adults between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-five have lost all of their teeth. Currently, there are a number of options available for people who have lost their teeth. One of the most versatile and affordable is a set of removable dentures.</p>

                                                LOVE this place! The Doctor made me feel at ease, and he is very friendly. Everyone there is just so sweet! I went there with a big hole and infected tooth, doctor recommended for root canal treatment. They numb you up with a gel before they use the needle which makes it a LOT easier to handle, TRUST ME. Barely felt it! Thanks Elite dental for the GREAT experience! Looking forward to getting my teeth worked on again! :)

                                                My MIL had tooth sensitivity issue and had to undergo 5 root canals and 8+ fillings. I stay in Kondapur and was not sure which Dentist I should choose as there are plenty of options here. After reading very good reviews about Elite Family Dental, I choose to go there even though it is a little far from the area I live in.

                                                I am extremely happy with the decision I took. Dr. Sanganand is highly professional and was very effective in performing the procedures. He explained everything in detail and gave us options on how to go ahead.

                                                All procedures are now done and my MIL has recovered quickly. I highly recommend this Doctor for any dental problems. Thank you Dr. Sanganand.   .

                                                I promise u will not leave the clinic without a Smile!!
                                                And it's not only because of the tooth job that you get done(which of course is exceptional) , but also with the way u will be taken care of from the moment you enter the place till u leave.  Right from the receptionist who welcomes you to the consultants who address your issues in the most concerned manner will make u feel as comfortable as it could possibly get.
                                                I totally recommend this clinic for all those who need to see a dentist and have a phobia, cause u will not have any post your experience here!
